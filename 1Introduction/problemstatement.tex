\subsection{Problem Statement}
Pet ownership is a source of immense joy, yet the associated responsibilities often lead to challenges. Traditional methods of managing pet care, such as scattered notes and reminders, frequently result in inefficiencies and overlooked tasks. This can create gaps in pet care, as comprehensive and easily accessible resources are limited. Additionally, the search for trustworthy veterinary services and suitable pet products proves time-consuming and confusing for pet owners. The absence of a centralized platform connecting pet owners with professional services compounds these challenges.

\noindent To address these challenges, the HelloPet app emerges as a comprehensive solution. This user-friendly platform streamlines pet management by offering centralized organization and reminders. It goes beyond by providing valuable training resources to support effective pet care. HelloPet also acts as a bridge, connecting pet owners with reliable veterinary services and quality pet products. Moreover, the app establishes an engaging community, fostering support among pet owners. By empowering both novice and experienced pet owners with essential tools and a supportive network, HelloPet ensures the well-being and happiness of beloved pets.
